# Project 2: Air quality forecasting system for NYC


NOTE: The project is still very much under development. Pieces of the project will be added to the repository as they're completed. 

## What's in the repository? 
* **download_transform_data.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing code for downloading all data needed to for the air quality forecasting model. Also contains code for transforming the data into a standard form (.csv files, needed for model training). Data includes: pollutant measurements from Queens NY, toll counts from major NY bridges and tunnels (best proxy for number of cars on the road that I could find), and weather observations from JFK, LGA, and central park.
