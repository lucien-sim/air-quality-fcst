NOTE: The project is still very much under development. Pieces of the project will be added to the repository as they're completed. 

## What's in the repository? 
* `download_new_data.ipynb`: IPython notebook to download hourly air quality and weather observations for all EPA monitoring stations in the US, over the past `N` years. 
* `data_wrangling.ipynb`: IPython notebook to extract observations for the relevant stations out of the downloaded files, and then place those observations in a SQLite database.
